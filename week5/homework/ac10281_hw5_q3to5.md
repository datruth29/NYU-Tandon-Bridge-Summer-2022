## Question 3: 

### 4.1.3: Recognizing well-defined algebraic functions and their ranges.

Which of the following are functions from $\mathbb{R} \text{ to } \mathbb{R}$? If $f$ is a function, give its range.

#### B) $f(x) = 1/(x^2 - 4)$

When $x=2$ or $x=-2$, $1/(x^2-4)$ becomes $1/0$. This is not possible, therefore this is not a function of $\mathbb{R} \text{ to } \mathbb{R}$ and is not well-defined.

#### C) $f(x) = \sqrt{x^2}$

Since $x^2$ will always produce either a positive number or a 0 and therefore will also produce a real number. This makes the function well-defined, with a range of 0 to $\mathbb{R}^{+}$.

### 4.1.5: Range of a function.

Express the range of each function using roster notation.

#### B)

Let $A = \{2, 3, 4, 5\}$
$f: A \to \mathbb{Z} \text{ such that } f(x) = x^2$

__Solution:__ $\{4, 9, 16, 25\}$

#### D)
$f: \{0, 1\}^{5} \to \mathbb{Z}$.

For $x \in \{0, 1\}^{5}$, $f(x)$ is the number of 1's that occur in x. For example $f(01101) = 3$, because there are three 1's in the string '01101'.

__Solution:__ $\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$

#### H)

Let $A = \{1, 2, 3\}$
$f: A \times A \to \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}$ where $f(x, y) = (y, x)$

__Solution:__ $\{(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)\}$

#### I)

Let $A = \{1, 2, 3\}$
$f: A \times A \to \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}$ where $f(x, y) = (y, x+1)$

__Solution:__ $\{(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)\}$

#### L)

Let $A = \{1, 2, 3\}$
$f: P(A) \to P(A).$ For $X \subseteq A, f(X) = X - \{1\}$

__Solution:__ $\{\emptyset, \{2\}, \{3\}, \{2, 3\}\}$

## Question 4:

### 4.2.2: Properties of algebraic functions.

For each of the functions below, indicate whether the function is onto, one-to-one, neither or both. If the function is not onto or not one-to-one, give an example showing why.

#### C) $h: \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}$. $h(x) = x^3$

This function is one-to-one.

This function is NOT onto. The integer 4 can never be a result of $h(x)$ since $h(1) = 1$ and $h(2) = 8$.

#### G) $f: \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}$, $f(x, y) = (x+1, 2y)$

This function is one-to-one.

This function is NOT onto. While x+1 is onto, the expression $2y$ can never be 1 since $2(0) = 0$ and $2(1) = 2$.

#### K) $f: \mathbb{Z^{+}} \times \mathbb{Z^{+}} \to \mathbb{Z^{+}}$, $f(x, y) = 2^x + y$

This function is NOT one-to-one. $(1, 3)$ and $(2, 1)$ both map to the output 5.

This function is NOT onto. The value 1, 2 can't be mapped in the target domain $\mathbb{Z^+}$ can't be mapped to by any value of $(x, y)$. This can be seen when you input the lowest values that be represented for $(x, y)$, that being $(1, 1)$. These values map to the value of 3.

### 4.2.4 Properties of functions on strings and power sets

For each of the functions below, indicate whether the function is onto, one-to-one, neither, or both. If the function is not onto or not one-to-one, give an example showing why.

#### B) $f: \{0, 1\}^3 \to \{0, 1\}^3$
The output of f is obtained by taking the input string and replacing the first bit by 1, regardless of whether the first bit is a 0 or 1. For example, f(001) = 101 and f(110) = 110.

__Solution:__ This function is neither one-to-one nor onto. Since the first bit of the input string is always replaced with 1, no elements in the \{0, 1\}^3 that start with a 0 can be mapped to, making this not onto. And since multiple values in the domain can be mapped to the same value in the target (for instance, $\{001\} = 101$ and $\{101\} = 101$), then this function can't be one-to-one.

#### C) $f: \{0, 1\}^3 \to \{0, 1\}^3$
The output of f is obtained by taking the input string and reversing the bits. For example $f(011) = 110$.

__Solution:__ This function is both one-to-one and onto.

#### D) $F: \{0, 1\}^3 \to \{0, 1\}^4$
The output of f is obtained by taking the input string and adding an extra copy of the first bit to the end of the string. For example, f(100) = 1001.

__Solution:__ This function is one-to-one but NOT onto. Onto functions must have a domain that is greater than or equal to it's target, $\vert A \vert = \vert B \vert$. Since $\vert \{0, 1\}^3 \vert \neq \vert \{0, 1\}^4$, this function cannot be onto.

#### G) 

Let A be defined to be the set $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\}$ and let $B = \{1\}$. $f: P(A) \to P(A)$. For $X \subseteq A$, $f(X) = X - B$. Recall that for a finite set A, P(A) denotes the power set of A which is the set of all subsets of A.

__Solution:__ 

### Give an example of a function from the set of integers to the set of positive integers that is:

#### A) one-to-one, but not onto.

#### A) onto, but not one-to-one.
$f(x) = |x|$

#### A) one-to-one, and onto.

#### A) neither one-to-one nor onto.
$f(x) = x^2$
