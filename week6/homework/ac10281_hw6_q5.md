## Question 5:

Use the definitnion of $\Theta$ in order to show the following:

### A) $5n^3 + 2n^2 + 3n = \Theta(n^3)$

In order to prove that $5n^3 + 2n^2 + 3n = \Theta(n^3)$ we will show that the upper-bound  is $5n^3 + 2n^2 + 3n = O(n^3)$ and the lower bound is $5n^3 + 2n^2 + 3n = \Omega(n^3)$.

First we will find the $O(n^3)$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
5n^3 + 2n^2 + 3n &<= 5n^3 + 2n^3 + 3n^3 \\
&= 10n^3 \\
&= c_1n
\end{aligned}
$$

We can see that $5n^3 + 2n^2 + 3n=O(n^3)$ when $c = 10$ and $n_0 = 1$.

Now let us find $\Omega(n^3)$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
5n^3 + 2n^2 + 3n &>= 5n^3  \\
&= 5n^3 \\
&= cn
\end{aligned}
$$

We can see that $5n^3 + 2n^2 + 3n=\Omega(n^3)$ when $c = 5$ and $n_0 = 1$.

Since $T(N) = O(n^3)$ and $T(N) = \Omega(n^3)$, it follows that $5n^3 + 2n^2 + 3n = \Theta(n^3)$.

### B) $\sqrt{7n^2 + 2n - 8} = \Theta(n)$

In order to prove that $\sqrt{7n^2 + 2n - 8} = \Theta(n)$ we will show that the upper-bound  $\sqrt{7n^2 + 2n - 8} = O(n)$ is  and the lower bound is $\sqrt{7n^2 + 2n - 8} = \Omega(n)$.

First we will find the $O(n)$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\sqrt{7n^2 + 2n - 8} &<=  \sqrt{7n^2 + 2n - 8} \\
&= \sqrt{7n^2 + 2n} \\
&= \sqrt{7n^2 + 2n^2} \\
&= \sqrt{9n^2} \\
&= 3n \\
&= cn
\end{aligned}
$$

We can see that $\sqrt{7n^2 + 2n - 8} = O(n)$ when $c = 3$ and $n_0 = 1$.

Now let us find $\Omega(n)$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\sqrt{7n^2 + 2n - 8} &>= \sqrt{7n^2 + 2n - 8}\\
&= \sqrt{7n^2 + 2n^2 - 8n^2} \\
&= \sqrt{7n^2 - 6n^2} \\
&= \sqrt{n^2} \\
&= n \\
&= cn 
\end{aligned}
$$

We can see that $\sqrt{7n^2 + 2n - 8} = \Omega(n)$ when $c = 1$ and $n_0 = 1$.

Since $T(N) = O(n)$ and $T(N) = \Omega(n)$, it follows that $\sqrt{7n^2 + 2n^2 - 8n^2} = \Theta(n)$.
