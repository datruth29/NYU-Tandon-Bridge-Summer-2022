The __intersection__ of sets $A$ and $B$, denoted by the denoted by the symbol $\cap$ and is read as _"$A$ intersect $B$"_, is the set of all elements that are elements of both $A$ and $B$.

The intersection operation can also apply to infinite sets:

$$
A = \{x \isin \mathbb{Z}: \text{ x is an integer multiple of 2}\} \\
B = \{x \isin \mathbb{Z}: \text{ x is an integer multiple of 3}\} \\
A \cap B = \{x \isin \mathbb{Z}: \text{ x is an integer multiple of 6}\} \\
$$

In a way, you can consider __interaction__ to be similar to an [[discrete-math.logic.operators.and]] operation in that the element must be in set $A$ __and__ set $B$ in order to be part of it's intersection.
