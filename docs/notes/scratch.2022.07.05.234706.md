## Set Identities

The set operations [[discrete-math.set.operators.intersection]], [[discrete-math.set.operators.union]] and [[discrete-math.set.operators.complement]] are all defined in terms of logical operations.

- Intersection is to [[discrete-math.logic.operators.and]]
- Union is to [[discrete-math.logic.operators.or]]
- Complement to [[discrete-math.logic.operators.negation]]

Laws of Propositional [[discrete-math.logic]] can be used to derive corresponding set identities. A __set identity__ is an equation involving sets that is true regardless of the contents of the sets in the expression.
