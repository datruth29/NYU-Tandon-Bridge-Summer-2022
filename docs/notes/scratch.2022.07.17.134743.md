## Rules of Inference with Quantifiers

Regarding Existential Instantiation:

Each use of it must be defined by a new element. So for instance:

$\exists x P(x)$

$\exists x F(x)$

For each hypothesis, if existential instantiation is used for each, then a new element must be defined separately

$P(c)$

$F(d)$


## Rational Numbers

A number $r$ is rational if there exist integers $x$ and $y$ such that $y \neq 0$ and $r = x/y$. Not that for a particular rational number r, the choice of x and y is not necessarily unique. For example, if $r = .5$, then $r = 1/2$ and $r = 2/4$.

## Divides

An integer $x$ __divides__ an integer $y$ if and only if $x \neq 0$ and $y = kx$ for some integer $k$.

The fact that $x$ divides $y$ is denoted $x \mid y$. If $x$ does not divide $y$, then that fact is denoted $x \nmid y$.

If $x$ divides $y$, then $y$ is said to be a __multiple__ of $x$, and $x$ is a __factor__ or __divisor__ of $y$.

## Prime and Composite Numbers

An integer $n$ is __prime__ if and only if $n > 1$, and the only positive integers that divide n are 1 and n.

An integer $n$ is __composite__ if and only if $n > 1$ and there is an integer $m$ such that $1 < m < n$ and $m$ divides  $n$.

## Inequalities

If $x$ and $c$ are real numbers, then exactly one of the following statements is true:

- $x < c$
- $x = c$
- $x > c$

A real number is __positive__ if and only if $x > 0$. A real number $x$ is __negative__ if and only if $x < 0$. A real number $x$ is __non-negative__ if and only if $x \geq 0$. A real number $x$ is __non-positive__ if and only if $x \leq 0$.
