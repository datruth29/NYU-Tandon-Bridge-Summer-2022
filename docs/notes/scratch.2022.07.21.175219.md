# Proof by Contradiction

A __proof by contradiction__ starts by assuming the __theorem__ is false and then shows that some logical inconsistency arises as a result of the assumption. A proof by contradiction is sometimes called an __indirect proof__.

The general idea been a proof by contradiction is that if we assume the theorem is false, and that assumption leads to a conclusion that cannot be true, then the theorem must be true.
