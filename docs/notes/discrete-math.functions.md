A function $f$ that maps elements of a set $X$ to elements of a set $Y$, is a subset of $X \times Y$ such that for every $x \isin X$, there is _exactly one_ $y \isin Y$ for which $(x, y) \isin f$.

$f: X \to Y$ is the notation to express the fact that $f$ is a function from $X$ to $Y$. The set $X$ is called the __domain__ of $f$, and the set $Y$ is the __target__ of $f$. An alternate word for target that is sometimes used is __co-domain__. The fact that $f$ maps $x$ to $y$ (or $(x, y) \isin f$) can also be denoted as $f(x)=y$.

If $f$ maps an element of the domain to zero elements or more than one element of the target, then $f$ is not __well-defined__.
