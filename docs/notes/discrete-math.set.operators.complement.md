The __complement__ of a set $A$, denoted $\overline{A}$, is the set of all elements in $\mathbb{U}$ that are not elements of $A$. An alternative definition of $\overline{A}$ is $\mathbb{U} - A$.

For example, let $\mathbb{U} = \mathbb{Z}$.

$$
A = \{x \isin \mathbb{Z}: x \text{ is odd }\}
$$

The complement of this set would be the set of all even integers.
