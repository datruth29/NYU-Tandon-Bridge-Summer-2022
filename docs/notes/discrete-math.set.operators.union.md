The __union__ of two sets $A$ and $B$, denoted $A \cup B$ and read as "_$A$ union $B$_" is the set of all elements that are elements of A or B. 

The definition for union is similar to the inclusive or, in that an element must be either in set $A$ __or__ set $B$ to be an element in $A \cup B$.

An example of this is the following:

$$
A = \{1, 2, 3\} \\
B = \{2, 5, 8\} \\
A \cup B = \{1, 2, 3, 5, 8\} \\
$$
