The [[discrete-math.set.operators.difference]] operations is not commutative, hence it is not always the case that $A-B = B-A$. In contrast, the __symmetric difference__ between two sets A and B, denoted $A \oplus B$, is the set of elements that are a member of exactly one of $A$, and $B$, but not both.

Alternative definition for symmetric difference is:

$$
A \oplus B = (A - B) \cup (B - A)
$$

Example:

$$
A = \{a, b, c, e, f\}
B = \{d, e, f, g\}
A = \{a, b, c, d, g\}
$$
