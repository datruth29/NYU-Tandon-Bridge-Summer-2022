__Question 1:__

A) Convert the following numbers to their decimal representation. Show your work.

1. $10011011_2 =$

Working from most significant bit to least:

$=1*2^7 + 0*2^6 + 0*2^5 + 1*2^4 + 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 1*2^1 + 1*2^0$

$=128 + 0 + 0 + 16 + 8 + 0 + 2 + 1$

__$=155$__

2. $456_7=$

Working from most significant bit to least:

$=4*7^2 + 5*7^1 + 6*7^0$

$=196+ 35 + 6$

$=237$

3. $38A_{16}=$

$=3*16^2 + 8*16^1 + 10*16^0$

$=768 + 128 + 10$

$=906$

4. $2214_5$

$=2*5^3 + 2*5^2 + 1*5^1 + 4*5^0$

$=250 + 50  + 5  + 4$

$=309$

B) Convert the following numbers to their binary representations:

1. $69_{10}$

First we find the most significant bit by finding the log of 69 and rounding down:

$log_2(69) = 6.108$

Rounded down we get $6$

$2^6 = 64$

$69-64=5$

$5-4=1$

$1-1=0$

|1|0|0|0|1|0|1|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|$2^6$|$2^5$|$2^4$|$2^3$|$2^2$|$2^1$|$2^0$|
|64|32|16|8|4|2|1|

$69 = 1000101$

2. $485_{10}$

First we find the most significant bit by finding the log of 69 and rounding down:

$log_2(485) = 8.921$

Rounded down we get $8$

$2^8 = 256$

$485-256=229$

$229-128=101$

$101-64=37$

$37-32=5$

$5-4=1$

$1-1=0$


|1|1|1|1|0|0|1|0|1|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|$2^8$|$2^7$|$2^6$|$2^5$|$2^4$|$2^3$|$2^2$|$2^1$|$2^0$|
|256|128|64|32|16|8|4|2|1|

$485=111100101$

3. $6D1A_{16}$

To get the binary equivalent, we have to get the binary for each digit, and then append each binary from the largest digit to the lowest.

|Hex|Bin|
|-|-|
|$6$|$0110$|
|$D$|$1101$|
|$1$|$0001$|
|$A$|$1010$|

$6D1A=0110 1101 0001 1010$

C) Convert the following numbers to their hexadecimal representation:

1. $1101011_2$

To convert from binary to hexadecimal, we want to divide the binary into chunks of 4 bits. From there, we can convert the value into into a single digit represented in hexidecimal. Once completed for each chunk, we can then append the values from highest to lowest.


|Bin|Hex|
|-|-|
|$1101$|$D$|
|$1011$|$B$|

$1101011=DB$

2. $895_{10}$
